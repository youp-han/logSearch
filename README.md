# logSearch
it looks up the keyword and shows the lines containing the keyword in the user specified file. txt, .log etc

# why?
I have to check log files from numbers of servers for specific activities.. 
so I built this to filter, "only lines with specific keywords" that I want to check

# how it works
1. drag & drop a text file.
2. or, Press "Log File" to open up the dialogbox to find a file.
3. type in a keyword to Search. By default, it has "error" in it
4. Press "Search" Button
5. It displays lines of search results in the textbox
6. as well as, it will drop a file, with the name and location shown in "Save Location"
7. Press "Open File" button if you want to check the saved file.


# Limitation
it works only on the windows environment, with dotnetFramework 4.0 and above installed
